# ARMTCT (Automated Real-time Manual Testing Coverage Tool)

ARMTCT is a Java-based desktop application designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of manual software testing. The tool provides real-time code coverage information and analytical dashboards to empower manual testers in optimizing their testing efforts. It integrates with the JaCoCo code coverage library to generate comprehensive coverage reports and visualize the execution coverage of testing classes and methods.

## Features

- Real-time code coverage: ARMTCT provides real-time coverage information on class coverage, method coverage, and statement coverage. This enables testers to assess the extent to which the software under test has been exercised by their test cases.

- Analytical dashboards: The tool presents the coverage information in a real-time analytical dashboard, utilizing histograms and pie charts. This allows testers to gain insights into the coverage achieved and identify areas that require additional testing.

- Source code access: Testers can access the source code of specific testing classes directly from the ARMTCT user interface. This provides them with the ability to examine the code and gain a better understanding of the testing material.

- Command prompt view: All analytical values can be viewed in a human-readable format in the command prompt window. This provides testers with a detailed overview of the coverage metrics and test results.

## Installation

1. Clone the ARMTCT repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ARMTCT.git
```

2. Ensure that Java is installed on your system i.e., Java 11 or latest.
3. Open command prompt in the ARMTCT repository.
4. Run the ARMTCT application by typing @compile and @run commands.


## Usage

1. Launch the ARMTCT application.

2. Provide the necessary inputs, such as the target application and the test data.

3. Perform manual testing on the target application.

4. Monitor the real-time code coverage information and analytical dashboards in the ARMTCT user interface.

5. Analyze the coverage metrics and identify any gaps or untested code segments.

6. Access the source code of specific testing classes for further examination, if needed.
